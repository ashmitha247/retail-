# GlitchGuard Screenshot Placeholders

This directory contains placeholder images representing the GlitchGuard interface.

## Screenshots Available:
1. **main-interface.png** - Main application interface
2. **config-panel.png** - Configuration sidebar
3. **validation-results.png** - Results dashboard
4. **progress-tracking.png** - Real-time progress indicator

## Note:
These are placeholder images. In a production environment, you would replace these with actual screenshots of the application.

## To Replace Placeholders:
1. Take screenshots of your deployed app
2. Save them with the same filenames
3. Update the README.md image links if needed
