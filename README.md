## 📚 **Key Terms Explained**

### **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**
Think of EDI as the "digital language" that businesses use to communicate. Instead of sending paper documents, companies exchange structured electronic files. For Walmart vendors, this means sending shipment notifications, invoices, and other business documents in a specific digital format.

### **ASN (Advance Shipment Notice)**
An ASN is like a "heads up" message you send to Walmart saying: *"Hey, I'm sending you a shipment with these specific products, quantities, and delivery details."* It helps Walmart prepare to receive your goods.

### **GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number)**
Your business tax ID in India. VendorLadon checks that it's in the correct format and valid for the state you're shipping from.

### **Validation Modules**
Think of these as different "quality checkers" that examine different aspects of your EDI file:

- **📋 EDI Structure**: Checks if your file follows the correct digital format
- **🏛️ GSTIN Format**: Verifies your tax ID is correctly formatted
- **📦 Product Codes**: Ensures all product identifiers are valid
- **⏰ ASN Timing**: Confirms shipment timing meets Walmart requirements
- **🔐 AS2 Certificates**: Validates security certificates for data transmission
