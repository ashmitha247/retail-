📚 How VendorLadon Works - A Beginner's Guide
Let me explain step-by-step how this application works, as if you're completely new to EDI and supply chain technology:

🤔 What Problem Does This Solve?
Imagine you're a vendor (supplier) selling products to Walmart India. Before you can ship your products, you need to send them a digital document called an "Advance Shipment Notice" (ASN). This is like a digital shipping manifest that tells Walmart:

📦 What products you're shipping
📊 How many of each item
🚚 When it will arrive
💰 Pricing and tax information (GSTIN)
The Problem: If this document has errors, Walmart's warehouse will reject your shipment, causing:

⏱️ Delays and missed delivery windows
💸 Financial penalties
📞 Long disputes and phone calls
😤 Frustrated customers
VendorLadon's Solution: Check your ASN before sending it to catch errors early!

🖥️ Using the Application - Step by Step
Step 1: Open the Application
The app is now running at: http://localhost:8501
You'll see a beautiful blue header: 🛡️ VendorLadon
It looks like a professional business application
Step 2: Configure Your Settings (Left Sidebar)
🏢 Vendor Information:

Vendor ID: Your unique Walmart vendor code (like WMTIN-REL100)
Shipment ID: A unique number for this shipment (auto-generated)
🗺️ State Selection:

Choose your state (for GSTIN tax validation)
Default is Maharashtra (27), but you can select any Indian state
✅ Validation Options:

EDI Structure: Checks if your file format is correct
GSTIN Format: Validates Indian tax ID numbers
Product Codes: Verifies barcodes and item numbers
ASN Timing: Ensures you're not submitting too early/late
AS2 Certificates: Checks digital security certificates
Step 3: Upload Your File
📁 File Upload Section:

Click "Choose an EDI file" button
Upload files with extensions: .txt, .edi, .x12, .csv
The app shows file size and gives you a preview
💡 Try This: Upload one of the sample files I created:

Navigate to sample_data
Try sample_asn.edi or sample_asn_with_gstin.edi
Step 4: Run Validation
⚡ Quick Validation:

Click the big blue "🔍 Validate EDI File" button
Watch the progress bar as it runs through each check:
🔄 Parsing EDI file...
✔️ Validating EDI structure...
🔍 Validating GSTIN...
📦 Validating product codes...
⏰ Validating ASN timing...
🔐 Validating AS2 certificates...
Step 5: Review Results
📊 Summary Cards:

✅ Ready to Submit (green) = No critical errors
❌ Not Ready (red) = Has errors that must be fixed
Counts: Shows number of errors, warnings, and validations performed
🔍 Detailed Results:

🚨 Errors: Critical issues that prevent submission
⚠️ Warnings: Advisory notices (won't block submission)
Each item shows:
Segment: Which part of the EDI file has the issue
Message: What's wrong
Details: Technical explanation
💡 Suggestion: How to fix it
Step 6: Download Reports
📋 Report Actions:

📄 Download JSON Report: Technical format for systems
📊 Download CSV Report: Spreadsheet format for analysis
JSON Preview: Quick look at the raw data
🔬 What Each Validation Does (In Simple Terms)
1. 🏗️ EDI Structure Validation
What it checks: "Is your file properly formatted?"

Like checking if a letter has the right address format
Ensures all required sections are present
Verifies control numbers match
Example Error: "Missing PO number segment" Why it matters: Walmart needs to know which purchase order this shipment fulfills

2. 🏛️ GSTIN Validation
What it checks: "Is your Indian tax ID correct?"

Validates 15-character GSTIN format
Checks state code matches your location
Verifies mathematical checksum
Example Error: "GSTIN state code mismatch" Why it matters: Tax compliance - wrong GSTIN can cause legal issues

3. 📦 Product Validation
What it checks: "Are your product codes real and valid?"

Validates GTIN-14 barcodes using international standards
Checks Walmart Item Numbers (WIN) against their database
Ensures product IDs exist and are formatted correctly
Example Error: "GTIN checksum validation failed" Why it matters: Wrong product codes = wrong items shipped

4. ⏰ Timing Validation
What it checks: "Are you submitting this at the right time?"

Ensures ASN is sent 0-24 hours before shipping
Prevents too-early or too-late submissions
Checks date formats and logic
Example Error: "ASN submitted too early (36 hours before shipping)" Why it matters: OTIF (On-Time, In-Full) performance affects your vendor rating

5. 🔐 Certificate Validation
What it checks: "Are your security certificates valid?"

Verifies AS2 certificates for secure transmission
Checks expiration dates
Validates trust chain with Walmart's root certificate
Example Error: "Certificate expires in 5 days" Why it matters: Expired certificates block electronic transmission

🎯 Real-World Example Walkthrough
Let's say you upload a file and get these results:

❌ Errors Found:

"GSTIN state code mismatch"

Your GSTIN says Maharashtra (27), but you selected Gujarat (24)
Fix: Update your state selection or correct the GSTIN
"Product code not found in database"

GTIN 12345678901234 doesn't exist in the master catalog
Fix: Double-check the barcode or register the product
⚠️ Warnings Found:

"ASN submitted 30 hours before shipping"
Not an error, but outside the optimal 24-hour window
Suggestion: Consider submitting closer to ship date
✅ Result: "Not Ready to Submit" - fix the 2 errors first
