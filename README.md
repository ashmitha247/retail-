## 📚 How VendorLadon Works - A Beginner's Guide
Let me explain step-by-step how this application works, as if you're completely new to EDI and supply chain technology:

🤔 What Problem Does This Solve?
Imagine you're a vendor (supplier) selling products to Walmart India. Before you can ship your products, you need to send them a digital document called an "Advance Shipment Notice" (ASN). This is like a digital shipping manifest that tells Walmart:

📦 What products you're shipping
📊 How many of each item
🚚 When it will arrive
💰 Pricing and tax information (GSTIN)
The Problem: If this document has errors, Walmart's warehouse will reject your shipment, causing:

⏱️ Delays and missed delivery windows
💸 Financial penalties
📞 Long disputes and phone calls
😤 Frustrated customers
VendorLadon's Solution: Check your ASN before sending it to catch errors early!

🖥️ Using the Application - Step by Step
Step 1: Open the Application
The app is now running at: http://localhost:8501
You'll see a beautiful blue header: 🛡️ VendorLadon
It looks like a professional business application
Step 2: Configure Your Settings (Left Sidebar)
🏢 Vendor Information:

Vendor ID: Your unique Walmart vendor code (like WMTIN-REL100)
Shipment ID: A unique number for this shipment (auto-generated)
🗺️ State Selection:

Choose your state (for GSTIN tax validation)
Default is Maharashtra (27), but you can select any Indian state
✅ Validation Options:

EDI Structure: Checks if your file format is correct
GSTIN Format: Validates Indian tax ID numbers
Product Codes: Verifies barcodes and item numbers
ASN Timing: Ensures you're not submitting too early/late
AS2 Certificates: Checks digital security certificates

Step 3: Upload Your File
📁 File Upload Section:

Click "Choose an EDI file" button
Upload files with extensions: .txt, .edi, .x12, .csv
The app shows file size and gives you a preview
💡 Try This: Upload one of the sample files I created:

Navigate to sample_data
Try sample_asn.edi or sample_asn_with_gstin.edi
Step 4: Run Validation
⚡ Quick Validation:

Click the big blue "🔍 Validate EDI File" button
Watch the progress bar as it runs through each check:
🔄 Parsing EDI file...
✔️ Validating EDI structure...
🔍 Validating GSTIN...
📦 Validating product codes...
⏰ Validating ASN timing...
🔐 Validating AS2 certificates...
Step 5: Review Results
📊 Summary Cards:

✅ Ready to Submit (green) = No critical errors
❌ Not Ready (red) = Has errors that must be fixed
Counts: Shows number of errors, warnings, and validations performed
🔍 Detailed Results:

🚨 Errors: Critical issues that prevent submission
⚠️ Warnings: Advisory notices (won't block submission)
Each item shows:
Segment: Which part of the EDI file has the issue
Message: What's wrong
Details: Technical explanation
💡 Suggestion: How to fix it
Step 6: Download Reports
📋 Report Actions:

📄 Download JSON Report: Technical format for systems
📊 Download CSV Report: Spreadsheet format for analysis
JSON Preview: Quick look at the raw data
🔬 What Each Validation Does (In Simple Terms)
1. 🏗️ EDI Structure Validation
What it checks: "Is your file properly formatted?"

Like checking if a letter has the right address format
Ensures all required sections are present
Verifies control numbers match
Example Error: "Missing PO number segment" Why it matters: Walmart needs to know which purchase order this shipment fulfills

2. 🏛️ GSTIN Validation
What it checks: "Is your Indian tax ID correct?"

Validates 15-character GSTIN format
Checks state code matches your location
Verifies mathematical checksum
Example Error: "GSTIN state code mismatch" Why it matters: Tax compliance - wrong GSTIN can cause legal issues

3. 📦 Product Validation

## Configuration & Customization

### Validation Rule Customization
Modify validation behavior by editing the respective validator modules:
- `validators/edi_validator.py` - EDI structure compliance rules
- `validators/gstin_validator.py` - Tax identification validation logic
- `validators/product_validator.py` - Product catalog management
- `validators/timing_validator.py` - Submission timing parameters
- `validators/certificate_validator.py` - Certificate security requirements

### Product Catalog Management
Update the product database in `validators/product_validator.py`:
```python
self.product_database = {
    '12345678901234': {'name': 'Product Name', 'category': 'Category'},
    # Add additional product entries
}
```

## Troubleshooting & Support
