## 📚 **Advanced Technology Explained**

### **EDI (Electronic Data Interchange)**
Think of EDI as the "digital language" that businesses use to communicate. Instead of sending paper documents, companies exchange structured electronic files. For Retail vendors, this means sending shipment notifications, invoices, and other business documents in a specific digital format.

### **ASN (Advance Shipment Notice)**
An ASN is like a "heads up" message you send to Retail saying: *"Hey, I'm sending you a shipment with these specific products, quantities, and delivery details."* It helps Retail prepare to receive your goods.

### **GSTIN (Goods and Services Tax Identification Number)**
Your business tax ID in India. VendorLadon checks that it's in the correct format and valid for the state you're shipping from.
